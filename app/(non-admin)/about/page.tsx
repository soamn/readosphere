          Coming from the Himalayas this space is my little conscious effort not
          to be swept away by the endless current of content online, I’ll admit:
          there are still days when YouTube eats up more time than I care to
          admit.
        </p>

          Somewhere between my work, some travels, and the quiet chaos of
          adulting, I realize—this isn’t the life I want to look back on. I want
          to grow old with a book in hand. And, reading has never just been
          about escape; it’s been about return.

          A return to self, to stillness, to wonder - and all this while living
          under "a Cherry & Oak tree". Perks of living in the mountains. For
          someone who believes in the healing power of calm, curiosity, and
          slowing down—not quick fixes or 30-second distractions—{" "}
          <b>this is about me!!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          A mindful corner filled with thoughtful reads and nature-inspired
          reflections. Some for reading, some for imagining, some for learning —{" "}
          <b>but mostly, for simply being.</b>
