        Coming from the Himalayas this space is my little conscious effort not
        to be swept away by the endless current of content online, I’ll admit:
        there are still days when YouTube eats up more time than I care to
        admit.{" "}

        Somewhere between my work, some travels, and the quiet chaos of
        adulting, I realize—this isn’t the life I want to look back on. I want
        to grow old with a book in hand. And, reading has never just been about
        escape; it’s been about return.

        A return to self, to stillness, to wonder - and all this while living
        under "a Cherry & Oak tree". Perks of living in the mountains. For
        someone who believes in the healing power of calm, curiosity, and
        slowing down—not quick fixes or 30-second distractions—{" "}

      <p className="mt-4">
        A mindful corner filled with thoughtful reads and nature-inspired
        reflections. Some for reading, some for imagining, some for learning —
        <b>but mostly, for simply being.</b>
